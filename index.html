        <p class='para'>In the recent years, the keeping of reptiles as pets has become quite popular. These exotic pets are typically easier to keep and do not require the same kind of attention that a typical pet like a dog or a cat. That is not to say that reptiles are better pets, but rather that they might fit the means of people with specific circumstances and interests. One particular type of reptile that has really picqued my interest recently has been Leopard Geckos. They're hardy little creatures and differ from their other gecko cousins by having eyelids. They're relatively easy to take care of when compared to other types of exotic reptile pets.</p>

        <p class='para'>Taking care of Leopard Geckos is surprisingly easy when you compare it to the needs of other reptiles. Leopard Geckos are crepuscular and come out when the Sun sets and stay out until early dawn. This is often confused with being nocturnal but they are not the same. Due to being crepuscular they don't sun bathe like most reptiles. Instead, they derive their energy from lying on top of rocks that have been sitting in the Sun. They draw the warmth into their bellies and throughout the rest of their body. From this fact, you do not need to have UVB lights (It still benefits them). Instead you need a deep-heat projector or a ceramic heater placed overhead ontop of a rock. This will to release ambient heat into the medium that they can absorb by lying down ontop of. They require a water dish with access to water and to be fed once or twice a week depending on how much you feed. They'll eat crickets, mealworms, roaches and many other kinds of insects as long as they are live. You will need to dust calcium and vitamin supplements onto their food every so often, while also providing a dish of calcium for them inside their enclosure to consume when they need it. Their enclosure should have multiple places to hide and sleep. They also need a humid hide, something that is moist so they can use the moisture for shedding their skin. All in all, a Leopard Gecko is not exceptionally hard to take care of but it doesn't mean that it is the easiest animal either. Utmost care should always be provided and proper research should be done.</p>
